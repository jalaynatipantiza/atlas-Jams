# Atlas Jams
 
## Project Description
Atlas Jams is a platform for hosts, performers, and ones who are looking for events to attend. On this platform performers can create a profile that will advertise their talent. Hosts can create and invite performers to perform at their event. Ones who are looking for an event to attend can browse through all the events and add it to their calender.
